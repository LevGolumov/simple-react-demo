Hello! This is my demo project. I admit, it is not the prettiest app in the world, but I've made it in a couple of days just to show, what technologies I can use.

This project is made with the React library. I stuffed it with the React Router, React Context, Redux and Axios.

For instanse, React Context is used for the locale choice. The Redux saves the table info, fetched from the Firebase by Axios. The pagination is implemented with the React Router.

This was a test assignement from one of the headhunters, and I upgraded it a bit. Initially the React Router, React Context, Redux and Axios weren't there.

In short: this page shows you the table from the backend. Users may filter it with the help of the drop-down lists. They also may sort it by the columns in ascending and descending ways.
